# AMLC of the Rockies Leadership

***Theory will only take you so far. Relationships are our superpower. Grow together.***

## Our Leadership Philosophy

AMLC of the Rockies is a **volunteer-driven, community-led** organization. Our leadership exists to serve the community, not to control it. We believe in:

- **Transparency**: All decisions, finances, and processes are open to the community
- **Servant Leadership**: Leaders empower others and remove obstacles
- **Distributed Authority**: Committees and working groups have autonomy
- **Accountability**: Leaders are accountable to the community they serve
- **No Salaries**: Every volunteer contributes time and talent freely

## Leadership Structure

### The Board

The board operates outside the inner rings of the community but serves to support and empower active contributors. Board members are volunteers who handle:

- **Financial Stewardship**: Managing funds transparently and responsibly
- **Legal Compliance**: Maintaining our 501(c)(6) nonprofit status
- **Strategic Partnerships**: Building relationships with sponsors and partners
- **Community Advocacy**: Representing AMLC in the broader ecosystem
- **Resource Allocation**: Ensuring community contributors have what they need

**Current Board Members**: [See website for current board](https://amlcoftherockies.org/leadership)

### Community Organizers

Organizers are the heart of AMLC - they coordinate events, facilitate discussions, and keep the community running smoothly. They are:

- Active community members who have demonstrated commitment
- Empowered to make decisions about events and activities
- Responsible for maintaining community culture and values
- Mentors to newer members and contributors

**Current Organizers**: [See website for current organizers](https://amlcoftherockies.org/leadership)

### Committee Leads

Each committee has designated leads who coordinate efforts within their domain. See our [Committees page](/Foundation/committees.md) for details on active committees and their missions.

## What Leadership Gets

Leadership doesn't come with financial compensation, but it does provide:

- **Deeper Connections**: Build meaningful relationships across the community
- **Visibility**: Showcase your leadership and organizational skills
- **Learning**: Develop skills in event planning, community building, and governance
- **Impact**: Shape the future of AI/ML community in the Rockies
- **Network Growth**: Connect with sponsors, partners, and community leaders
- **Personal Growth**: Challenge yourself and grow through service

The value leadership gets is the same value every member gets: **connections, visibility, access to opportunities, and the ability to experiment, build, and learn together.**

## Accountability and Transparency
