# Our Commitment to Transparency

## The AMLC Transparency Pledge

**Applied Machine Learning Collective of the Rockies commits to radical transparency in how we operate, make decisions, and serve our community.**

This handbook is not just documentation - it is our **public, permanent record** of who we are, what we do, and why we do it.

## What Transparency Means to Us

### 1. Open Decision-Making

**All significant community decisions are documented publicly:**

- Community Enhancement Proposals (CEPs) are discussed in the open
- Policy changes go through public pull requests
- Leadership decisions are documented with rationale
- Budget allocations and spending are tracked publicly

**Why?** Because our community deserves to know how and why decisions are made.

### 2. Permanent Historical Record

**The git history of this handbook preserves everything:**

- Every change is tracked with who made it and when
- Pull request discussions show the debate and iteration
- Issues document problems and how they were resolved
- Proposals show what was considered, even if not adopted

**Why?** Because institutional memory matters. New members should understand our journey, and we should learn from our past.

### 3. Public Accountability

**Anyone can:**

- See our [financial information](/Foundation/community-funding.md)
- Review our [governance structure](/Foundation/community-structure.md)
- Read our [Code of Conduct](/Foundation/code-of-conduct.md) and enforcement guidelines
- Understand how to [join leadership](/Foundation/leadership.md)
- Propose changes through [CEPs](/Foundation/proposals.md)

**Why?** Because transparency builds trust, and trust builds community.

### 4. Beyond the Website

**The handbook vs. the website:**

| [Handbook](https://github.com/amlcoftherockies/amlc-handbook) | [Website](https://amlcoftherockies.org) |
|---|---|
| **Source of truth** | **Public showcase** |
| Governance & decisions | Events & highlights |
| Policies & processes | Community stories |
| Proposals & discussions | Getting started info |
| Historical record | Current activities |
| **Where work happens** | **Where we shine** |

**Why both?** The website welcomes people in. The handbook shows them how we work.

## What Gets Documented

### ✅ Always Public

These are **always** documented in this public handbook:

- **Governance**: Structure, policies, processes
- **Proposals**: All CEPs and their outcomes
- **Finances**: Budget, spending, fundraising
- **Leadership**: Roles, responsibilities, selection
- **Code of Conduct**: Rules and enforcement
- **Major Decisions**: What was decided and why
- **Community Offerings**: Events, programs, benefits

### 🔒 Temporarily Private (Staging)

These start in the **private staging repo** but become public when ready:

- **Work in Progress**: Drafts being refined
- **Sensitive Discussions**: Until consensus is reached
- **Member Feedback**: Being synthesized into proposals
- **Experimental Ideas**: Being validated before sharing

**Important**: Everything in staging is **intended to become public**. It's not secret - it's just not ready yet.

### 🚫 Never Public

These are **never** in the handbook (they go elsewhere):

- **Personal Information**: Member contact details, addresses
- **Private Conversations**: One-on-one discussions
- **Confidential Reports**: Code of Conduct violations
- **Security Issues**: Vulnerabilities in our systems
- **Legal Matters**: Contracts, agreements (unless approved by counsel)

**These belong in**: Private channels, email, Discord DMs, or secure systems.

## How We Maintain Transparency

### The Pull Request Process

Every change to this handbook:

1. **Starts as a proposal** (issue or CEP)
2. **Discussed in a pull request** (comments, suggestions, iterations)
3. **Reviewed by the community** (organizers, reviewers, members)
4. **Merged when consensus is reached** (becomes part of the official record)
5. **Preserved forever in git history** (can always see what changed and why)

**This process ensures**: Nothing sneaks in. Everything is discussed. All voices are heard.

### Accountability Mechanisms

**How we stay accountable:**

- **Public git history**: Can't hide changes
- **Pull request discussions**: Can't skip debate
- **Required approvals**: Can't self-approve (reviewers)
- **Community review**: Can't ignore feedback
- **Permanent record**: Can't rewrite history

## Living Our Values

This commitment to transparency reflects our core values:

### 🏆 Win Together
Transparency ensures we all have the same information to make decisions together.

### 🌐 Network === Net Worth
Open communication builds trust and strengthens relationships.

### 📈 Continuous Growth
Documenting our journey helps us learn from successes and failures.

### 👁️ Perspective is Everything
Public discussions bring diverse viewpoints to every decision.

### 🧠 Collective Intelligence
Shared knowledge creates a smarter, more capable community.

## Questions About Transparency?

### "Why is this public?"
Because we believe communities are stronger when they operate in the open. Transparency builds trust, enables participation, and creates accountability.

### "What if I disagree with a decision?"
Great! Submit a [Community Enhancement Proposal](/Foundation/proposals.md) or comment on an existing pull request. We welcome constructive discussion.

### "Can I see old versions of policies?"
Yes! Use git history or GitHub's file history feature to see every version and why it changed.

### "How do I propose a change?"
See [How to Make a Pull Request](/Foundation/proposals.md#how-to-make-a-pull-request) for step-by-step instructions.

### "What if something needs to be private?"
Some things (personal info, security issues, legal matters) should stay private. Everything else defaults to public.
