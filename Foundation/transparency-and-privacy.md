# Transparency and Privacy Guidelines

## 🌍 Our Commitment to Radical Transparency

**This repository is PUBLIC.** Everything here—including the `staging` branch, all issues, PRs, discussions, and commit history—is visible to the world.

We believe in **transparent sausage-making**: showing our work, our thought process, and even our mistakes helps build trust and allows others to learn from our journey.

### What This Means

✅ **All work is public by default**
- Issues and discussions are visible to everyone
- PRs and code reviews are public
- Commit history shows the evolution of ideas
- Even work-in-progress on the `staging` branch is visible

✅ **The "sausage-making" is transparent**
- Rough drafts and iterations are visible
- Debates and disagreements are documented
- Changes and pivots are tracked in git history
- Learning happens in public

✅ **This requires extra care**
- Follow our [Code of Conduct](/Foundation/code-of-conduct.md) at all times
- Be respectful in all public discussions
- Assume everything you write will be read by the public
- Think before you post—it's permanent and public

## 🔒 When Privacy is Needed

While we default to transparency, some situations require privacy:

### Legitimate Private Discussions

**Personal matters**:
- Individual member concerns
- Conflict resolution
- Personal information or sensitive situations

**Legal/HR matters**:
- Legal advice or compliance issues
- Personnel decisions
- Financial account details (not budgets—those are public)

**Security issues**:
- Vulnerability reports
- Security incident response
- Access credentials or tokens

**Pre-announcement planning**:
- Surprise events or announcements
- Partnership negotiations (until finalized)
- Grant applications (until submitted)

### How to Have Private Discussions

#### Option 1: Email Leadership (Recommended)
**Email**: leadership@amlcoftherockies.org

**Best for**:
- Personal concerns
- Sensitive matters
- Quick questions that don't need group discussion

**What happens**:
- Leadership reviews and responds
- If it becomes a policy decision, it will be documented publicly (without personal details)
- You can request to remain anonymous in public documentation

#### Option 2: Discord Private Channels
**Discord**: [AMLC Discord](https://discord.gg/XsHBtnBH)

**Best for**:
- Real-time discussions
- Member-only conversations
- Brainstorming before public proposal

**What happens**:
- Private channels for members only
- Decisions made there should be documented publicly afterward
- Use `#private-leadership` or `#members-only` channels

#### Option 3: Private Repository (For Sensitive Projects)
**When to use**: Multi-person collaboration on sensitive matters

**Process**:
1. Submit a CEP proposing a private repository
2. Justify why it must be private
3. Define what will eventually be made public
4. Set a timeline for transparency (if applicable)

**Examples**:
- Security vulnerability tracking
- Grant application collaboration
- Partnership negotiations

#### Option 4: GitHub Security Advisories
**When to use**: Security vulnerabilities only

**Process**:
1. Go to repository → Security → Advisories
2. Report a vulnerability privately
3. Organizers will review and coordinate disclosure

**Best for**:
- Code vulnerabilities
- Security issues in our systems
- Responsible disclosure

## 🎯 The Staging Branch Workflow

### How We Use the Staging Branch

The `staging` branch is **public but work-in-progress**:

```
staging branch (PUBLIC WIP)
    ↓
    Review & iterate publicly
    ↓
    PR to main when ready
    ↓
main branch (PUBLIC & APPROVED)
```

### Staging Branch Guidelines

**What goes on staging**:
- ✅ Work-in-progress proposals
- ✅ Draft documentation
- ✅ Experimental ideas
- ✅ Rough drafts that need feedback
- ✅ Iterative improvements

**What does NOT go on staging**:
- ❌ Sensitive personal information
- ❌ Security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Private member data
- ❌ Confidential partnership details
- ❌ Anything that violates Code of Conduct

**Remember**: Staging is public! Don't put anything there you wouldn't want the world to see.

### Branch Protection

**Staging branch**:
- Open for commits from organizers and reviewers
- Encourages experimentation and iteration
- PRs to main require review

**Main branch**:
- Protected—requires PR and approval
- Represents "official" approved content
- Higher bar for quality and completeness

## 🚫 What NOT to Post Publicly

Even with radical transparency, some things should NEVER be posted publicly:

### Never Post:
- ❌ Personal contact information (addresses, phone numbers, personal emails)
- ❌ Passwords, API keys, tokens, or credentials
- ❌ Social Security numbers, tax IDs, or financial account numbers
- ❌ Private medical or health information
- ❌ Confidential legal advice or privileged communications
- ❌ Unannounced security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Personal conflicts or grievances (use private channels)
- ❌ Anything that violates someone's privacy
- ❌ Anything that violates our Code of Conduct

### If You Accidentally Post Sensitive Info:

1. **Don't panic**, but act quickly
2. **Delete the content** immediately
3. **Contact leadership** at leadership@amlcoftherockies.org
4. **Rotate credentials** if passwords/keys were exposed
5. **Document the incident** (privately) for learning

**Remember**: Git history is permanent. Deleting a commit doesn't remove it from history. We may need to use tools like `git filter-branch` or contact GitHub support.

## 💬 Code of Conduct Reminder

**This repository is public.** Everything you write here represents AMLC and is visible to:
- Current and prospective members
- Potential sponsors and partners
- The broader ML/AI community
- Future employers and colleagues
- The general public

**Always**:
- ✅ Be respectful and professional
- ✅ Assume good intent
- ✅ Disagree constructively
- ✅ Focus on ideas, not people
- ✅ Follow our [Code of Conduct](/Foundation/code-of-conduct.md)

**Never**:
- ❌ Personal attacks or insults
- ❌ Harassment or discrimination
- ❌ Sharing others' private information
- ❌ Trolling or bad-faith arguments
- ❌ Anything you wouldn't say in person at a community event

## 🎓 Learning in Public

**Transparency means showing our learning process:**

### It's OK to:
- ✅ Propose ideas that might not work
- ✅ Change your mind based on feedback
- ✅ Make mistakes and learn from them
- ✅ Ask "dumb" questions (there are no dumb questions!)
- ✅ Iterate and improve proposals
- ✅ Disagree respectfully

### The Benefits:
- 🌟 Others learn from our process
- 🌟 Builds trust through honesty
- 🌟 Creates a searchable history
- 🌟 Encourages participation
- 🌟 Models healthy collaboration

## 📞 Questions?

**Not sure if something should be public or private?**

**Ask yourself**:
1. Does this contain personal/sensitive information? → Private
2. Is this a security vulnerability? → Private (security advisory)
3. Is this a policy decision that affects the community? → Public
4. Would I be comfortable with this on the front page of a newspaper? → If yes, public

**Still not sure?** Email leadership@amlcoftherockies.org and ask!

## 🔄 Transparency Audit

We periodically review what's private vs. public:

**Quarterly review**:
- What private discussions can now be made public?
- Are we defaulting to transparency?
- Are we protecting privacy appropriately?
- What can we learn and share?

**Annual transparency report**:
- Summary of private vs. public decisions
- Lessons learned
- Improvements to transparency practices

---

**Remember**: Transparency is a practice, not perfection. We're learning together how to balance openness with privacy, and we'll iterate as we go.
