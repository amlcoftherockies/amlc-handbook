# Proposals
The AMLC of the Rockies is a living community—always evolving through shared ideas and contributions. To propose changes that enhance the community itself (e.g., structure, governance, initiatives), submit a pull request to the `Proposals` directory in this repository.

For other types of proposals—such as talks you'd like to give, topics you’d like to see covered, or activities you’d like to recommend—please use the designated repositories for events and programming. This allows us to keep proposals organized and routed to the appropriate working groups.

This document outlines:

    What types of proposals belong here

    Where to submit proposals for events and activities

    How to write and submit a Pull Request for community enhancements

## Community Enhancement Proposals

Community enhancment proposals are submitted directly to [AMLC Handbook repository](https://github.com/amlcoftherockies/amlc-handbook).
We decided on this structure because we believe these communty enhancements will make their way into our community's core, and therefore the lineage of these enhancments makes sense to document within the handbook repo. The enhancement process was inpsired by the [Kubernete's community enhancment process](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps)

### Do I have to use the Proposal Process?

We highly recommend it. 

Submitting proposals through the official process helps keep ideas visible, organized, and open for collaboration. It also builds a structured historical record of decisions, priorities, and initiatives.

Formal proposals are required for:

    Community-wide changes (structure, process, or direction)

    New initiatives that require resources or coordination

    Changes that could be controversial

    Anything that would benefit from broad input or long-term tracking

For smaller efforts, you don’t need to go overboard—proposals should be lightweight and approachable. Think of them as a conversation starter with structure

### Why would I want to use the Proposal Process?
The proposal process isn’t just a formality—it’s how we:

    Make decisions transparent and collaborative

    Invite feedback and contributors early

    Track the evolution of community ideas

    Avoid duplicating effort by surfacing related initiatives

    Build trust through shared understanding

We’re inspired by other open communities like Python’s PEPs, Rust’s RFCs, and Kubernetes KEPs, but we aim to keep things lightweight and inclusive.


### Where should I put my proposal?

    Community Enhancement Proposals: Submit a Pull Request to the Proposals/ directory in this repository.

    Talks or Activity Proposals: These belong in separate repos for Events and Programming (links provided in this doc).

If you're not sure where something goes, just ask in the community [AMLC of the Rockies Discord](https://discord.gg/XsHBtnBH), [email leadership](leadership@amlcoftherockies.org) or post an issue—we'll help guide it to the right place.


### What will it take for proposals to feel successful?

Success for us means:

    Proposals are clear, collaborative, and actionable

    Community members feel welcome to contribute and improve them

    Ideas move forward with alignment and shared ownership

    There's a searchable, browsable history of how things evolved

As we grow, we’ll iterate on this process. Like everything in AMLC, it’s open to improvement.


### My question isn’t answered here!

We’re still refining this process! If you have a question, reach out to the organizers,maintainers, other leaders, or open an issue. Want to improve the proposal process itself? Great! Submit a proposal for that too!
