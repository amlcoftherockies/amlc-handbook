# Community  Structure

## Vision
**Purpose-Driven:** A community needs to have a clear purpose that its members believe in and are willing to work towards. This purpose should be communicated clearly and consistently.
**Relationships First:** Relationships are the cornerstone of a strong community. Members should feel connected to one another and be able to trust and support each other.
**Continuous Improvement:** A community should always be looking for ways to improve, both for the individual members and for the community as a whole. This involves regularly evaluating progress and making changes as needed to stay aligned with the community's purpose

## A Third Place

We as a community strive to be:

* Comfortable and informal.
* Convenient.
* Unpretentious.
* There are regulars.
* Conversation is the main activity.
* Laughter is frequent.
