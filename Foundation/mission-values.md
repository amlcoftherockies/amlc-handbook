# The Applied Machine Learning Collective of the Rockies Mission and Values

***In machine learning and life: collective communication scales.***

## Mission Statement
Our community is a hands-on, inclusive space where AI and ML practitioners come together to explore, discuss, and shape the future of artificial intelligence. We foster curated discussions and collaborative problem-solving around real-world challenges and opportunities. As a volunteer-driven, community-led initiative, we’re committed to empowering members through shared learning, open dialogue, and diverse perspectives, while opening doors to career, educational, and social opportunities that showcase their AI/ML talents.


## Why Community?

***Theory will only take you so far. Relationships are our superpower. Grow together.***

In today’s world, we’re inundated with content claiming to offer the “best” tools or the “optimal path to value”—often without understanding who they’re actually talking to. This leaves individuals investing time and resources into tools, skills, or systems that may not truly address their needs.
We recognize that the ML stack is too broad for any one person or team to master entirely, and the industry moves quickly. That’s why hearing from those who’ve been in the hot seat across different roles is so valuable—it helps us understand how to better build for, support, or collaborate with other teams.


## Values
* Win Together. (Because we are together) Through **time**, **talent**, and **treasure.**
* (Network === Net Worth)
* Growth is a coninous journey not a final destination
* Perspective is everything 
* Insights through real stories from people invested in your success.


## Outcomes (What's in it For You?)

***Ultimately, knowledge is just a rumor until it’s embodied enough to drive action.***

We intentionally named this secion based on [Joe Polish's](https://joepolish.com/) book [What's in it for Them?!](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/63189090-what-s-in-it-for-them), because we believe in the mission of building a "Genius Network" or in our case a Collective Intelligence Mesh: An emergent intelligence from many agents contributing knowledge and synthesizing shared insights.
Through collective communication and learning, we hope to drive real results for community memmbers. Results can be intrinsic (helping a colleague learn a new skill) or extrinsic (using the new skill to generate revenue).
Some examples we are targeting are: 
* New/Better Jobs in the the ML/AI field through deeper networks and a curated recruiting process. 
* Deeper networks of folks you can hire, pick the brains of, or just talk shop with. No selling unless at a designated event! 
* Collective knowledge and experience from local like-minded peers
* Social and fun events [third place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place)
* Have more conversations with real folks who own technical quality (not quotas) 


## Founding Tenets 
* **Community:** Provide the physical space and events for people to forge real-deal relationships that lead to friendships, professional connections, sales opportunities, job referrals, product referrals, and human connections. 
* **Solidarity:** We provide support for our members' growth and personal challenges in the ever-changing landscape of the country's, state's, and city's economies
* **Education:** Grow our members' skill sets by sponsoring and creating events to showcase new technologies, soft skills, hard skills, software, etc. 
* **Career Growth:** As a community, we should work to vet and compile our members' resumes, helping people secure jobs, enhance their skills, and expand their professional networks. This will create a safe space for networking and establish genuine connections that facilitate job opportunities and sales for our members. This includes vetting recruiters or those who want access to the community to keep the community safe. Accessing this community is a privilege and we want to protect our members from spam or unwanted sales motions with room for economic mobility and opportunity. 
* **Personal Growth:** Create a “third space” for members to meet, socialize, develop friendships, debate topics, develop ideas, provide support, learn, and achieve. A safe space to innovate and collaborate.
