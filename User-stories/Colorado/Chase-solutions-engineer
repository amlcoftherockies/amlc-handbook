# Chase the Solutions Engineer

Chase is a solutions engineer focused on helping technical teams get revenue-generating wins. His job is part technical solutions expert, part business driver.

## Problem

Chase knew his solution, but wasn't going to help teams drive value or real outcomes flying blind. He believes that understanding where a solution fits best builds trust and ensures he is helping teams long-term. As a startup solutions engineer, Chase is constantly evaluating whether the "new way" he's proposing is truly the right one.

He needed users who had used other solutions—so he could learn from them, partner with them, and understand what they do well—to better set everyone he engages with up for success. With so many ways to solve problems and so many tools worth learning, Chase wanted real-world validation—not just vendor marketing.

## How Did You Discover the Community?

Chase found the community on Meetup and decided to attend. He had just moved to Colorado and was incredibly excited to meet new technical folks.

## How Did the Community Help You?

Chase learned a TON from the community. He learned about how folks understand Open Source, what data scientists care about, and met several people he would later build a new community with to serve the one that supported him.

## What Did You Contribute Back?

Chase became an organizer for the community and began leading discussions on Open Source, Kubeflow, and Kubernetes. He even flew in his community mentor (Amber) to give an Open Source and Kubeflow talk to the group!

## What Happened As a Result?

Chase developed a deep passion for connecting with others. He often says, "Community and solutions is a contact sport. Let's be in front of people and build real relationships." He also co-founded the AMLC of the Rockies community to help others in Denver get jobs, contribute to projects, and build meaningful connections.

## Future Contributions or Goals

Chase hopes to keep serving the community and develop more offerings to help members get what they want out of AMLC.
