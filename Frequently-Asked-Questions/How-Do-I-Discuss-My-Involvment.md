# ❓ How Can I Communicate the Value of The Machine Learning Collective of the Rockies to My Current Organization?

If your team or leadership notices your involvement in AMLC—whether on LinkedIn, GitHub, or through public events—they might wonder how it relates to your role or if its a conflict of interest. Here’s how to clearly and confidently frame it as an opportunity, not a distraction:

* AMLC is a Nonprofit, not a Competitor
We’re not selling products or generating revenue for individuals. We exist to support the ML/AI community by investing in education, collaboration, and shared resources.

* It Directly Supports Your Professional Development
Whether you’re in MLOps, Solutions Engineering, DevOps, or Data Science, AMLC helps you sharpen your skills, stay current, and bring back practical insights that benefit your team.

* It Increases Your Visibility and Credibility
Community involvement demonstrates initiative, leadership, and the ability to collaborate across orgs—qualities that are increasingly valuable in technical roles.

*  It Helps Your Company Stay Close to the Ecosystem
Being part of AMLC connects you to real-world challenges and conversations happening in the field. That proximity can inform better technical decisions and even open the door to speaking, hiring, or partnership opportunities.

* It’s Transparent and Balanced
AMLC is built on full transparency. We’re happy to share how funds are used, how members contribute, and how we avoid conflicts of interest. Your time and engagement are respected, and we encourage balance with your primary work responsibilities.

## How Can I Get Additional Support? 
If you ever need help explaining your involvement or want support communicating with leadership, we’re here to help. We can even provide a one-pager, explainer deck, or co-host a session to walk through what AMLC is and how it creates value for individuals and the organizations they serve.
