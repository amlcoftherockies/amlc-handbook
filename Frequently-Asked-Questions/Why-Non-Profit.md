# ❓ Why Does The Machine Learning Collective of the Rockies Have a Formal Organization?

The AMLC of the Rockies is a [501c6 organization](https://www.coloradosos.gov/biz/BusinessEntityDetail.do?quitButtonDestination=BusinessEntityResults&nameTyp=ENT&masterFileId=20251789122&entityId2=20251789122&fileId=20251789122&srchTyp=ENTITY) registered with the state of Colorado. 

We formed AMLC as a nonprofit organization to provide **structure**, **transparency**, and **sustainability**, not to generate personal income for the founding team or organizers.

With an official organization backing our community, we can ensure we have the business infrastructure required to pool our resrouces and scale the community with full auditability and accountability through the state. We also build credibility and can diffrentiate reaching out as the official org or a community member. This is why we have both the `amlcoftherockies.net` and `amlcoftherockies.org` domains. We want to ensure we can have an organization staffed by volunteers to be available for opportunites that can benefit the community as well as be accountable to a [board](/Foundation/community-structure.md) who's invested in ensuring the organization aligns with the AMLC of the Rockies` vision and mission. 

## What About Membership Fees?

Yes, we do charge membership fees and accept sponsorships, but every dollar is reinvested directly into the community. That includes things like:

    Event space and logistics

    Shared infrastructure and tools

    Speaker support and workshop materials

    Community-led projects and initiatives

    Volunteer reimbursements and accessibility resources

No one on the founding team is drawing a salary. The org exists to amplify what individuals can’t do alone, pool resources, unlock opportunities, and scale collective learning.

## What's in it for The Machine Learning Collective of the Rockies Board and Leadership? 

The value the AMLC leadership gets is the same value every member gets: connections, visibility, access to opportunities, and the ability to experiment, build, and learn together. The returns are not financial—they’re human, professional, and technical.

By organizing as a nonprofit, we commit to full transparency and shared ownership of outcomes. The community is the organization.
