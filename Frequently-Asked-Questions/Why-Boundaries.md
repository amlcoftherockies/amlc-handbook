# If the Goal of the AMLC of the Rockies is to be Inclusive, Why Do We Have "Rings" or Boundaries!? 
Inclusion doesn’t mean a lack of structure, it means intentional design that welcomes and empowers.
At AMLC of the Rockies, our use of “rings” or boundaries is not about exclusion, it’s about clarity, sustainability, and accessibility

## Rings Reflect Commitment and Capacity. Not Hierarchy.

We recognize that people have different levels of time, energy, and interest. The rings are designed to:

    Let casual members drop into events and learn at their own pace.

    Let dedicated contributors shape initiatives and build programs.

    Let stewards ensure continuity, governance, and sustainability.

Everyone belongs — the rings just reflect how someone chooses to participate. Let's use the often referenced "Jazz Trio" as an example. 

## Feedback Is Welcome — From Those Playing in the Band

There’s nothing like jamming in a jazz trio. Especially when the players really listen, show up prepared, selfless, and passionate. It’s risky. It’s improvisational. But with the right people in the band, you can take bold solos, push the groove, and still be supported. Because even if you stumble, they catch you, and the music goes on.

That’s the kind of community we’re building at AMLC of the Rockies.

We’re not looking for perfection. We’re looking for people in the arena, people in the band, who want to play, learn, and build something remarkable together. Feedback is essential, but it has to come from people who share the values, show up consistently, and understand the song we’re all trying to play.

## Why Boundaries Help the Music

We intentionally draw boundaries. Not to exclude, but to protect that feeling of playing in sync.

 To make sure:

    Feedback comes from a place of shared investment, not critique from the sidelines.

    People feel safe enough to take risks, because they know the others in the room have their back.

    Effort is seen, supported, and rewarded — not exploited or drowned out.

Everyone is welcome to join the band, but we ask that you tune your instrument, learn the rhythm, and commit to the groove. Trust takes time. And the music deserves that time.  By "Music" we mean Machine Learning, AI, and other community projects we all work towards together! 

## TL;DR
We can’t be everything to everyone. If we try, we risk losing what binds us and makes The AMLC of the Rockies special.
Yet, we do want to make sure that anyone genuinely interested has the opportunity to learn, grow, and eventually shape where we go next. Boundaries aren’t walls! They’re scaffolding.
They help us protect our values, build trust, and grow intentionally — together.
