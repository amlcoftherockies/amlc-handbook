## 🎯 Key Messages Established

### The Handbook's Purpose
```
Handbook = Official Source of Truth
Website = Public Showcase

Handbook: Where decisions are made, documented, and preserved
Website: Where we shine and welcome people in
```

### What Gets Documented
- ✅ **Always Public**: Governance, proposals, finances, leadership, major decisions
- 🔒 **Temporarily Private (Staging)**: Work in progress, intended to become public
- 🚫 **Never Public**: Personal info, private conversations, security issues

### Why It Matters
- **Transparency** builds trust
- **Accountability** builds credibility
- **History** builds institutional memory
- **Openness** builds community
