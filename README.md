# Community Handbook

***Our Commitment to Transparency: This handbook is the official, public record of AMLC of the Rockies.***

This handbook serves as the **centralized source of truth** for the Applied Machine Learning Collective (AMLC) of the Rockies. It documents our mission, policies, processes, proposals, and the internal conversations that shape our community's direction. Inspired by [The GitLab Handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com/), which open-sourced the structure of an entire organization, we similarly value transparency and open dialogue.

## Why This Handbook Exists

This is more than documentation - it's our **public commitment to transparency and accountability**:

- **Official Record**: All community decisions, proposals, and governance changes are documented here
- **Historical Archive**: The git history preserves the evolution of our community and the reasoning behind decisions
- **Public Accountability**: Anyone can see how and why decisions were made
- **Community Memory**: New members can understand our journey and learn from past discussions
- **Beyond the Website**: While our [website](https://amlcoftherockies.org) showcases our community, this handbook is where the real work happens

We believe strong leaders and strong communities are unafraid to share their ideas and welcome constructive discussion as long as it follows our [Code of Conduct](/Foundation/code-of-conduct.md).

## 📚 AMLC Repository Ecosystem

AMLC of the Rockies maintains several repositories to organize different aspects of our community:

- **[amlc-handbook](https://github.com/amlcoftherockies/amlc-handbook)** (this repo) - **Official public record**: Community handbook, policies, governance, proposals, and decision history
- **[amlc-handbook-staging](https://github.com/amlcoftherockies/amlc-handbook-staging)** (private) - Internal discussions and work-in-progress content before public release
- **[amlc-programming](https://github.com/amlcoftherockies/amlc-programming)** - Event proposals, talks, workshops, and activities
- **[amlcoftherockies.org](https://github.com/amlcoftherockies/amlcoftherockies.org)** - Official website source code (public-facing showcase)

### The Handbook vs. The Website

- **Handbook** (this repo): The authoritative source of truth - where decisions are made, documented, and preserved
- **Website**: Public-facing showcase - highlights, events, and community information

**For members:** See [Two-Repository Workflow](/Systems/two-repo-workflow.md) for how to work with both public and staging repos.

**For complete setup documentation:** See [COMPLETE-SETUP-INDEX.md](/COMPLETE-SETUP-INDEX.md) - Master index of all handbook systems, configurations, and enhancements.

## Updating the ALMC of the Rockies Handbook
We highly encourage folks to read, comment, and challenge the AMLC of the Rockies Handbook. Our community isn't about worshipping the certainty of our opinions, it's about growth and the exchanging of ideas knowing that perspective changes everything. We recognize that in both [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity) and community, truth can appear different from different vantage points. That’s why dialogue and challenge are essential. We’re not just seeking consensus, we’re seeking understanding. Therefore, we've provided ways to update our handbook and discuss ways to improve the topics it covers. 

### Updating the Handbook: Open an Issue
One great way to start a conversation or ask a question on a particular topic, is to open an issue.  When opening an issue, please use the recommended github issue tags mentioned below. 

#### What Makes a Good Issue?

A **good issue** clearly communicates a problem, question, or proposal in a way that others can understand, engage with, and act on. For the AMLC Handbook, a good issue fosters shared understanding and constructive community discussion. Issues might lead to someone updating the handbook with a `pull request`, or simply helps clairify/answer questions. Think of this as a way to determine if you need to make a PR or contribute a [Community Enhancement Proposal](/Foundation/proposals.md)
